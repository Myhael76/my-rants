# Lehman's SPE Classification Importance is Underestimated

Note: This article is still work in progress :)

Lehman's classification is primarily associated to software programs. A simple [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=S-programs+P-Programs) may shed the relevant light into the audience awareness if necessary.

According to Lehman, the software programs may be classified as:

- **S-Type**: Specifiable
- **P-Type**: Where the acceptance is "procedural" and cannot be determined upfront
- **E-Type**: Embedded in the real world, i.e. they substantially act as "agents", having the ability to product real world impacts, some of those with feedback effects

In my opinion, this classification may be extended further to other types of programs, for example for companies programs management, personal or family growth programs and so on. Management methods such as [PERT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pert-chart.asp) or [CPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method) are addressing this type of programs.

I am also looking at this classification from a "problem" perspective like this:

- **S-Type programs** address **S-Type problems**
- **P-Type programs** address **P-Type problems**
- **E-Type programs** address **E-Type problems**

Now, to me, the biggest bias in management mindsets is the fact many school of thought are assuming all or the majority of the problems are "S-Type". PERT for example is a programming tool that substantially assumes that an excruciatingly detailed **specification** can be produced upfront. While this may be true for the construction domain, where mankind has more than 5000 years experience and the domain actually allows for good predictability, it is definitely not to case for software in general, where the change may occur extremely fast.

**For P and E type of problems, an agile form of program management is required.**

P and E type problems require a different approach and this is why agile methods were brought to life and are gaining more and more ground.

As an example, how frequently have you seen a "risk" in classical project management that the "users are not good at telling what they want" ( aka "producing specifications"). Have you actually noticed the project management team actually asking themselves "are we expecting a specification while our problem is of "P-type"?). On the same line, how many times have you been in a situation where a change request must be formalized, because a requirement was not expressed when the project plan expected the specifications to be "approved" according to the milestone in the plan? Worse still, as the customer did not want to accept the CR, how did the project go? Did it go ahead with decisions that were not improving the customer's life just because a detailed SOW was written in legalese stone with the contract?
